        // (mainly in app.jsx) and any page inside it' tag(as it's children)
        //will be seen as props.children 

        //eg:

    //  <App /> here App is props.children

/* HOW Socket Provider method and useSocket method get's used"

⬆️ This tells React:

“Hey React, before rendering anything else in my app, first run SocketProvider and make the socket available to everything inside.”

📦 3. Now inside any child component, you use:

const socket = useSocket(); // under the hood: useContext(SocketContext)
This line doesn't run SocketProvider — it just reads the value (socket) that SocketProvider already put into SocketContext.Provider.
